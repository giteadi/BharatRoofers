          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Energy Efficiency for Savings and Sustainability:</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">
            These built homes are equipped with energy-efficient technologies. This not only helps you save on utility bills but also reduces your carbon footprint, contributing to the environment.

          </p>

          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Enhanced Community Living:</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">

          <h5 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Completion Time:</h5>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">

          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mx-3">
